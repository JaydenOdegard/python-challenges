# 🐍 Python Challenges

Welcome! This repository contains a growing collection of Python coding challenges, each designed to build your problem-solving skills and spark curiosity.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project began as part of my own Python learning journey. I'm organizing and sharing these challenges to help others — whether you're just starting out or looking to stretch your thinking with fun, focused exercises.

## 📁 Repo Structure

Here's how things are laid out:

```
python-challenges/
├── README.md          # You're here!
├── .gitignore         # Keeps the repo clean
├── challenges/        # Each challenge gets its own folder
│   ├── challenge_01/
│   │   ├── challenge_01.py
│   │   ├── hint_01.md
│   │   └── hint_02.md
│   ├── challenge_02/
│   │   ├── challenge_02.py
│   │   └── hint_01.md
├── notes/
│   └── ideas.md       # Challenge ideas and learning notes
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run a challenge:

```bash
python challenges/challenge_01/challenge_01.py
```

Make sure you're using Python 3. Clone the repo and explore any challenge that catches your eye.

## 🧩 Challenges & Hints

Each challenge folder contains:
- A `.py` file with the prompt and your working code.
- One or more `.md` files with optional hints to guide you toward a solution.

## 🤝 Contributions Welcome

If you have ideas, want to add challenges, or offer improvements, feel free to open an issue or pull request! This is a space for shared learning and encouragement.

Let me know if you'd like:
- A table of challenges (I can auto-generate it once you upload them)
- A version that includes visuals like badges or emojis
- A shorter “quick-start” style version

Happy to tweak it however you'd like!
