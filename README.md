# 🐍 Python Challenges

Welcome! This repository is a collection of Python challenges I worked through while learning the language. Each challenge is broken down into a dedicated folder with hints, a problem description, and a solution — all designed to make learning feel approachable and fun.

Whether you're just starting your Python journey or exploring how others learn, you're in the right place!

## 🎯 Purpose

This project began as a personal learning log and grew into a space to share the ups, downs, and "aha!" moments of coding. I'm sharing it publicly in hopes that it can help, inspire, or simply encourage others learning Python too.

## 🚀 How to Use

Each challenge has its own folder and includes:

- A `README.md` explaining the challenge prompt
- One or more `hint_XX.md` files for guided nudges
- A `challenge_XX_solution.py` script that shows the solution I came up with

To try a challenge:
1. Read the `README.md` in the challenge folder.
2. Try solving it on your own first!
3. Check the hints if you're stuck.
4. Compare with the `solution.py` when you're ready.

Run code from the terminal like this:

```bash
python challenges/challenge_01/challenge_01_solution.py
```
