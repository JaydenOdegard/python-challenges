# Challenge 01 ‚Äì Daily Mood Tracker üß†üå§Ô∏è

Build a Python console program that:

1. Lets the user log their mood for the day (e.g., "happy", "sad", "stressed")
2. Tracks how many times each mood has been logged
3. Lets the user view mood statistics
4. Runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Use **functions** for key actions (e.g., logging, displaying)
- Use **loops** to allow multiple entries
- Use **conditionals** to handle menu choices
- Use **lists or dictionaries** to track moods
- Keep everything in a **single session** (no file saving unless you stretch it)

---

## üí¨ Example Flow

```
Welcome to Mood Tracker!
1. Log mood
2. View mood stats
3. Exit

Enter your choice: 1
How are you feeling today? happy

Mood recorded!
```
