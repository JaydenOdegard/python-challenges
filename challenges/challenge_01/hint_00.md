#### 1️⃣ Log the user's mood (e.g., "happy", "sad", "stressed")

🧠 **Hint:**  
You'll need a way to ask the user for input and store their answer.

📚 **Topic to research:**  
[`input()` function in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input)

---

#### 2️⃣ Track how many times each mood has been logged

🧠 **Hint:**  
You need a way to store labeled data that can be updated over time.

📚 **Topic to research:**  
[Python dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) and how to update values

---

#### 3️⃣ View mood statistics

🧠 **Hint:**  
You need to access and display the stored data in a readable way.

📚 **Topic to research:**  
Looping through dictionaries and basic output formatting

---

#### 4️⃣ Loop until user chooses to exit

🧠 **Hint:**  
You'll want your main menu to repeat until the user says to stop.

📚 **Topic to research:**  
[`while` loops](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#while-statements) and control flow in Python
