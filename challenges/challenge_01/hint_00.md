### ðŸ§  Starting Point: Log mood input

**What to ask yourself:**
- How do I ask a user a question in Python?
- How do I take their answer and store it?

---

**Start with:**

```python
mood = input("How are you feeling today?")
print(mood)  # test that it's working
If you want to offer choices, show them as a numbered menu and store the input as a number:


print("1. Happy\n2. Sad\n3. Stressed")
choice = int(input("Choose your mood: "))
Study terms:

input()

print()

int()

if/else
